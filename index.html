    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>As a political scientist, I have keenly been following Kizza Besigye, Bobi Wine, Mugisha Muntu, Nobert Mao and M7 during this COVID-19 pandemic. 
        Some, in many ways, have scored political wins and others not much.

At first, M7 seemed to be offering the leadership a country needed during a crisis. His scores proliferated. But instead of capitalizing on it, his political fame blinded him and either his policy advisors lied to him or he didn’t listen to them. So many mistakes have been made – some of which may forever remain the nadir of NRM’s political reign. Sadly, M7 and his group had all the costumes, rhythms and instruments to be the best dancers (for they were the only dancers in the theatre after all). Alas, poor choreography and lack of creativity disabled them from putting up an exceptional dancing performance. And the audience who had bought the expensive tickets got frustrated.</p>
